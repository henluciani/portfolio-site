# Overview
This is my personal portfolio site, inspired by leerob.io. The project is a fork of the original Leerob's portfolio site, and I've made several customizations and enhancements to better fit my style and needs.

# Features
Framework: Built with Next.js, a popular React framework for server-rendered applications.
Deployment: Hosted on Vercel, which provides seamless integration with Next.js for optimized performance.

## Custom Enhancements:
- Enhanced homepage with react animation.
- Modified navigation to incorporate a custom card component for a more personalized touch.


## Deployment
The project is deployed to Vercel. For deployment updates or configurations, refer to the Vercel dashboard associated with this project.
